## You don't run this — we host it for you

Sentinel Command Center is a **product we operate as a service**, not something you download and deploy. To use it, just **[sign up on the live app](https://opensentry-command.fly.dev)** — no servers to provision, no Docker, no database to babysit. Pair a [CameraNode](https://github.com/SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-CameraNode) with a camera and it appears in your dashboard automatically.

> **Looking for the part you actually install?** That's **[CameraNode](https://github.com/SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-CameraNode)** — a small daemon that turns any USB or IP camera into a private, cloud-connected feed. It runs on your hardware and has its own setup guide.

### So why is this repo public?

**Trust.** Sentinel is built on the idea that your security footage should be *yours*, and you shouldn't have to take our word for how it's handled. So the code behind every privacy and security claim on the site is right here, in the open — auditable by anyone. It's licensed [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE): source-available, with the obligation that anyone who modifies it and runs it as a network service publishes their changes too.

---

## What it does

📹 &nbsp;**Live video, private by design** — CameraNodes push video straight to your dashboard through an in-memory proxy. Your recordings stay on your own device; Command Center keeps only a short live buffer in memory, never a copy of your footage at rest.

🔔 &nbsp;**Motion & alerts** — real-time motion events, a unified notification inbox, and opt-in email for the things that matter: a camera going offline, a node low on disk, a new incident.

🤖 &nbsp;**AI that investigates, not just alerts** — the optional Sentinel agent watches for motion and incidents and looks into them for you, filing reports with snapshots and short clips.

🔌 &nbsp;**Fits your setup** — a one-key [Home Assistant](https://github.com/SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-HomeAssistant) integration (on every plan), plus an MCP server so AI assistants like Claude can view your cameras and review past incidents.

👥 &nbsp;**Built for teams and multiple sites** — organizations with role-based access, multi-tenant isolation, and an audit trail on every sensitive action.

## How it fits together

```
   Your network                        Our cloud                       You
 ┌──────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
 │     CameraNode    │  outbound │   Command Center     │         │    Browser   │
 │  camera + FFmpeg │══════════▶│   live proxy +       │◀═══════▶│   dashboard  │
 │  records locally │   HTTPS   │   dashboard + API    │  HTTPS  │  (live video)│
 │  (your footage)  │           │  (short live buffer, │         │              │
 └──────────────────┘           │   not your archive)  │         └──────────────┘
                                └──────────────────────┘
```

CameraNode captures and encodes video on your network, then pushes it **outbound** to Command Center over HTTPS — no inbound ports, no port-forwarding, no VPN. Command Center holds a short rolling buffer in memory and streams it to your browser. Your actual recordings never leave your CameraNode.

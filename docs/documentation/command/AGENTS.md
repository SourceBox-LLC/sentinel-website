# AGENTS.md

The developer reference for **Sentinel Command Center**: the cloud dashboard and API for the **Sentinel by SourceBox** security-camera system. It is written for engineers and coding agents changing this repository. For how the whole system fits together, read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](/command/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first. For the AI agent in depth, read [docs/SENTINEL_AGENT.md](/command/docs/SENTINEL_AGENT.md).

**In one paragraph.** A Rust backend ([axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)) and a React 19 frontend, in one repo and one Docker image. Browsers sign in with Clerk (hosted) or a local admin account (self-hosted). CameraNodes push live video into an in-memory segment cache, and browsers play it as HLS. There is no object storage in the live path: no S3, no Tigris, no presigned URLs. Data lives in PostgreSQL (hosted) or SQLite (the self-hosted default). The Sentinel AI agent is a second binary from the same crate.

## Names and identifiers

The product has had three names: **OpenSentry** (early), **SourceBox Sentry** (mid-2026), and **Sentinel by SourceBox** (current). **Sentinel AI** is the name of the AI-agent feature only.

| Thing | Current name |
| --- | --- |
| This repo | `SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-Command` (was `OpenSentry-Command`; GitHub redirects the old URL) |
| Camera daemon repo | `SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-CameraNode` (was `opensentry-cloud-node`) |
| The app (dashboard and API) | `https://app.sentinel-command.com`, the Fly app `sentinel-command` |
| Marketing site and user docs | `https://sentinel-command.com` (GitHub Pages), docs at `/documentation/` |
| CameraNode binary | `sourcebox-sentry-cameranode` (renamed from `…-cloudnode` on 2026-09-09) |

**Do not rename these without a migration plan.** They outlived the rebrands on purpose:

- the env-var prefix `SOURCEBOX_SENTRY_*` (CameraNode);
- the Windows install path `C:\ProgramData\SourceBoxSentry\`;
- the agent env vars `OPENSENTRY_API_BASE`, `OPENSENTRY_MCP_AGENT_KEY`, `OPENSENTRY_MCP_URL`;
- the CameraNode AES key-derivation domain `opensentry-cameranode-machine-id-v2` (`database.rs::KEY_DOMAIN_V2` in that repo). This one is dangerous: change it and an existing encrypted `node.db` silently fails to open. It was renamed once, on 2026-09-09, while there were zero installs; from the first real install on, it needs a migration.

**Use `app.sentinel-command.com`, not `sentinel-command.fly.dev`.** Both reach the same machine. But Clerk session tokens carry the origin they were minted for (`azp`), and the backend accepts only `FRONTEND_URL`. So sign-in works on `app.sentinel-command.com` only.

## Repository layout

Command Center and the Sentinel AI agent ship from **one repo, one image, one deploy**. They run as two Fly *process groups* of the `sentinel-command` app, on separate machines.

| | Command Center | Sentinel AI agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | `backend-rs/` + `frontend/` | `backend-rs/src/agent/` (same crate) |
| Process group | `app` | `agent` |
| Command | `/usr/local/bin/sentinel-command` | `/usr/local/bin/sentinel-agent` |
| Machine | 1 GB, always on, owns the `/data` volume | 512 MB, always on, no volume |

```text
backend-rs/     Rust: the web tier, the agent, two operator tools
frontend/       React 19 + Vite; built into backend's static dir
scripts/        installer and MCP setup scripts the backend serves; DB backup/restore
docs/           architecture, agent, runbooks, ADRs, legal drafts
Dockerfile      one image: frontend build + both Rust builds (Postgres and SQLite)
fly.toml        both process groups; read its comments before changing memory or scaling
```

**Five rules. Break one and a deploy breaks.**

1. **One `Cargo.toml` builds both binaries, so a dependency change is a change to both.** `rig-core` and `rig-reqwest` are the agent's alone and are pre-1.0, so a minor version is a breaking release. Dependabot is told to leave their minors alone (`.github/dependabot.yml`). Move them by hand and check the agent's wire behaviour.
2. **`[[mounts]]` must stay scoped to `processes = ["app"]`.** Unscoped, it applies to every group, and the agent machine fails to boot competing for the volume's single attachment slot.
3. **`[processes]` overrides the Dockerfile `CMD`.** The `app` command in `fly.toml` must stay in sync with that `CMD` (both are `/usr/local/bin/sentinel-command`, no arguments).
4. **Required checks are matched by name, so renaming a CI job hangs every PR.** `master` requires `Backend tests (sqlite)`, `Backend tests (postgres)` and `Frontend audit + build`, all produced by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (which also runs `Backend tests (no database)`). GitHub reports *no status at all* for a check that never runs, so a renamed job looks like a stuck check, not a config error.
5. **CI path filtering is asymmetric on purpose.** `push` is filtered (docs-only pushes don't deploy). `pull_request` is **never** filtered, for the reason in rule 4.

CI runs on pull requests and on pushes to `master`, **not** on pushes to other branches. Its first backend step is `cargo fmt --check`: run `cargo fmt` before pushing.

## Build, run and test

**Prerequisites:** the Rust toolchain pinned in the `Dockerfile` builder stage (`rust:1.98`), and Node 18+.

```bash
# Backend (PostgreSQL build)
cd backend-rs
cargo run                              # http://localhost:8000, needs DATABASE_URL=postgresql://…
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./sentinel.db cargo run --features sqlite   # the SQLite build

# Tests
cargo test                             # no database needed; DB-gated tests skip themselves
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… cargo test   # also runs the Postgres integration tests
cargo test --features sqlite           # SQLite build; its DB tests always run, on a fresh file
cargo fmt                              # CI rejects unformatted code
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings                    # zero warnings, both builds
cargo clippy --all-targets --features sqlite -- -D warnings

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                            # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :8000
npm run build                          # → frontend/dist, copied to /app/static in the image
npx vitest run                         # frontend tests
```

Give `TEST_DATABASE_URL` a database of its own: the integration tests insert rows.

### Self-hosted, with Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` runs Command Center with PostgreSQL. `docker-compose.sqlite.yml` runs one container with the database as a file on its volume. Both use `AUTH_PROVIDER=local`: one admin account, no Clerk, no billing.

```bash
cp backend-rs/.env.example .env              # set LOCAL_ADMIN_USERNAME and LOCAL_ADMIN_EMAIL
openssl rand -hex 32                         # → APP_SECRET_KEY
docker compose run --rm --no-deps app sentinel-hash-password    # → LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
docker compose up -d                         # http://localhost:8000
```

**Put the password hash in single quotes in `.env`.** An argon2 hash is full of `$`, and Compose interpolates `.env` values: unquoted, `$argon2id$v=19$m=65536…` arrives as `=19=65536…` and every login fails with no explanation. Use `-f docker-compose.sqlite.yml` for the SQLite variant.

Without Docker: `cargo run --bin sentinel-hash-password` (or `--stdin`), set the variables under [Local auth](#local-auth-self-hosted), and set `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER=local` in `frontend/.env`.

### Operator tools

Both ship in the image on `PATH`:

```bash
fly ssh console -a sentinel-command -C sentinel-hash-password
fly ssh console -a sentinel-command -C "sentinel-restore-from-cloud --list"
```

### Running the agent locally

```bash
cd backend-rs
OLLAMA_API_KEY=… SENTINEL_AGENT_KEY=dev-secret AGENT_MODE=poll \
OPENSENTRY_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 WEBHOOK_VERIFY_SIGNATURE=false \
  cargo run --bin sentinel-agent          # :8080; also reads a .env in its working directory
```

## Configuration

Everything is an environment variable. `backend-rs/.env.example` is a commented starting point; this section is the full reference. `fly.toml`'s `[env]` sets the two non-secret production values (`FRONTEND_URL`, `SEGMENT_CACHE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`); everything else in production is a Fly secret.

### Required

| Variable | When | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | `AUTH_PROVIDER=clerk` (the default) | The issuer and JWKS URL are derived from the publishable key. |
| `APP_SECRET_KEY`, `LOCAL_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `LOCAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `AUTH_PROVIDER=local` | See [Local auth](#local-auth-self-hosted). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | hosted | Unset, it is `sqlite:///./sentinel.db`. A hosted machine without it would start on an empty file, which is why it stays a Fly secret. |

### Core

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER` | `clerk` | `clerk` or `local`. Must match the frontend's `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./sentinel.db` | `postgresql://…` / `postgres://…`, or `sqlite:///relative` / `sqlite:////absolute`. A `postgresql+psycopg://` suffix is stripped. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | The address people open the dashboard at. It is the Clerk `azp` the backend accepts, a CORS origin, and the base of every link in an email. Production: `https://app.sentinel-command.com`. |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | — | Extra CORS origins, comma-separated. `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:8000` are always allowed. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | on under Fly, else off | Take the client address from `Fly-Client-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For`. Off, the TCP peer is used. It decides rate-limit buckets and the IP in the audit log. Turn it on only behind your own reverse proxy, and make the proxy overwrite `X-Forwarded-For`. |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Listen port. |
| `STATIC_DIR` | `/app/static` | The built frontend. |
| `SCRIPTS_DIR` | `/app/scripts` | Where `/install.sh` and `/mcp-setup.*` are read from. |
| `REDIS_URL` | — | Shared rate-limit counters. Without it, counters are per process: fine on one machine. Production has used Upstash on Fly; confirm with `fly secrets list`. |
| `API_DOCS_ENABLED` | off under Fly, else on | Serves `/api-docs`, `/api-redoc` and `/api/openapi.json`. |
| `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Svix signing secret for `/api/webhooks/clerk`. Unset, every delivery is refused. |
| `LOCAL_ORG_ID` | `self-host` | The single org in local-auth mode. |

### Live video cache

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SEGMENT_CACHE_MAX_PER_CAMERA` | `60` | Segments kept per camera (~60 s at CameraNode's 1-second segments). |
| `SEGMENT_CACHE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` | `402653184` (384 MiB) | Ceiling across all cameras; oldest segments go first. **Must stay well under machine RAM**, or the OOM killer takes every org's streams at once. Change it together with `[[vm]] memory_mb`; see the `fly.toml` comment. |
| `SEGMENT_PUSH_MAX_BYTES` | `2097152` | Largest accepted segment. |
| `PLAYLIST_PUSH_MAX_BYTES` | `65536` | Largest accepted playlist. |
| `CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | `20` | Run cache eviction every N playlist updates. |
| `SEGMENT_CACHE_EVICT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | How often caches of cameras that stopped pushing are dropped. |
| `VIEWER_USAGE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | How often viewer-seconds are written to the database. |
| `AUTH_CACHE_SECONDS` | `10` | How long a segment request's auth result is cached. |

### Sentinel AI and self-hosted licensing

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SENTINEL_AGENT_KEY` | — | Shared secret for the run-queue API (`X-Sentinel-Agent-Key`) and the HMAC on wakeup webhooks. ⚠️ Multi-tenant: its holder can drain every org's queue. Never give it to a customer; issue an `osa_` key instead. Unset disables only the first-party agent path. |
| `SENTINEL_AGENT_MCP_KEY` | — | The first-party agent's bearer for the MCP tools. |
| `SENTINEL_AGENT_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | Where wakeups go. Production: `http://sentinel-command.flycast:8080/wakeup` (the `agent` process group over Fly's private network). Unset, no webhook is sent and the agent must poll. |
| `SENTINEL_DISPATCH_ENABLED` | `true` | Kill switch for creating new runs. |
| `SENTINEL_GLOBAL_MONTHLY_RUN_CAP` | `0` (none) | Fleet-wide ceiling on runs per month, on top of the per-plan caps. |
| `SENTINEL_LICENSE_KEY` | — | Self-hosted only. Unlocks Sentinel AI, and cloud data-sync if the licence includes it. |
| `SENTINEL_LICENSE_SERVICE_URL` | `https://sentinel-license.fly.dev` | |
| `SENTINEL_SYNC_SERVICE_URL` | `https://sentinel-sync.fly.dev` | |

The agent's own variables are in [docs/SENTINEL_AGENT.md](/command/docs/SENTINEL_AGENT.md#configuration).

### Email (Resend)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED` | `false` | Global kill switch. Off, the worker still runs and logs "would have sent". |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | — | |
| `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Svix secret for `/api/webhooks/resend`. |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `notifications@sentinel-command.com` | Must be on a Resend-verified domain. No-reply by design. |
| `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | `Sentinel by SourceBox` | |
| `EMAIL_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `5` | Outbox drain interval. |
| `EMAIL_WORKER_BATCH_SIZE` | `20` | Rows per drain. |
| `EMAIL_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Retries before a row is marked failed. |
| `EMAIL_TEMPLATES_DIR` | — | Preview template edits without rebuilding. Unset in production: the 46 templates are compiled in, so a missing one is a build error. |

### Error tracking (Sentry)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | — | Unset, Sentry is a no-op. Production gets it from the Fly Sentry extension. |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0.1` | |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | `production` under Fly, else `development` | |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | `FLY_MACHINE_VERSION` | |

Sentry is wired through `tracing`, **so `tracing::error!` is an alert.** ERROR lines become Sentry events and INFO/WARN become breadcrumbs. The disk-critical alert (`loops.rs`) depends on this. Query strings are stripped from every event before it leaves (`sentry.rs::scrub`), because an old CameraNode WebSocket handshake carried `api_key=` in the URL.

### CameraNode versions and loop intervals

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MIN_SUPPORTED_NODE_VERSION` | see `config.rs` | CameraNodes below this are refused at registration (426). |
| `LATEST_NODE_VERSION` | see `config.rs` | Fallback for "update available" until GitHub is reached. |
| `RELEASE_CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `600` | How often the latest CameraNode release is fetched. |
| `OFFLINE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `30` | |
| `MOTION_DIGEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | |
| `SENTINEL_REAPER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `300` | |
| `DISK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `300` | |

**Not read, despite appearing in old docs:** `INACTIVE_CAMERA_CLEANUP_HOURS` (caches are dropped a minute after a camera stops pushing), `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (retention is per plan), and `SENTINEL_LICENSE_GRACE_HOURS` (the 72-hour grace is a constant in `license.rs`).

### Frontend

`frontend/.env`: `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER` (`clerk` or `local`), `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL` (empty in development: Vite proxies), `VITE_LOCAL_HLS` (development only: stream straight from a CameraNode on `localhost:8080`).

## How a request flows

```text
Browser ───── Clerk or local JWT ─────▶ axum ──SQL──▶ PostgreSQL | SQLite
CameraNode ── X-Node-API-Key (HTTP) ──▶  │  ──RAM──▶ segment cache, broadcasters
           ── WebSocket /ws/node ─────▶  │
MCP client ── Bearer osc_… / osa_ ────▶ rmcp → scope gate → tools
Agent ─────── X-Sentinel-Agent-Key ───▶ run-queue API
```

Every query filters by the `org_id` taken from the authenticated credential, never from the request body.

## Live video

1. CameraNode cuts 1-second `.ts` segments with FFmpeg.
2. It pushes each one: `POST /api/cameras/{id}/push-segment?filename=segment_NNNNN.ts`, raw body, `X-Node-API-Key`.
3. The backend keeps the bytes in `hls.rs`'s cache (camera → filename → bytes), evicting the oldest past `SEGMENT_CACHE_MAX_PER_CAMERA`.
4. CameraNode pushes the rolling playlist: `POST /api/cameras/{id}/playlist`.
5. The backend rewrites segment names to relative `segment/<file>` URLs and caches the playlist. It strips any `#EXT-X-CODECS` line, which is only valid in a master playlist. The codec CameraNode reports (`POST /api/cameras/{id}/codec`) is stored on the camera and node rows instead.
6. The browser fetches `GET /api/cameras/{id}/stream.m3u8` and each `segment/{file}` with its JWT (HLS.js `xhrSetup`), served from memory.
7. Every served segment counts against the org's monthly viewer-hours (see [Plans and limits](#plans-and-limits)).
8. A 60-second sweep drops the caches of any camera that has stopped pushing.

A camera suspended by its plan's camera cap gets **402** with a `plan_limit_hit` body on push-segment. CameraNode treats that as non-retryable, and the heartbeat response lists suspended cameras so the node stops uploading them.

## Serving the frontend

`spa.rs::fallback` runs only when no route matched:

- Paths under `/api`, `/ws`, `/install.`, `/mcp-setup.`, `/downloads/`, `/.well-known/` and `/security.txt` get **404 `{"detail": "Not Found"}`**, never the React page. A CameraNode asking for a removed route must not get a 200 HTML page.
- `POST /mcp` redirects (307) to `/mcp/`, the MCP endpoint. `GET /mcp` is the React MCP page.
- `/assets/*` is served from the built frontend; anything else gets `index.html` for client-side routing.
- A known path with the wrong method is **405** with `Allow` and the body `{"detail": "Method Not Allowed"}`.

`/` redirects hosted visitors to the marketing site. A self-hosted install (`VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER=local`) goes to `/dashboard` instead.

Every response carries `X-Request-Id`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, a referrer policy and a permissions policy, plus HSTS over HTTPS (`headers.rs`).

**Content-Security-Policy.** Built once at start-up (`headers::content_security_policy`) and sent on every response. Scripts run only from this origin, Clerk's frontend host (derived from the publishable key), Cloudflare's bot check and Stripe (`js.stripe.com` and its `*.js.stripe.com` subdomains, per Stripe's published CSP); there is no `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'` for scripts. Styles allow `'unsafe-inline'` because Clerk injects `<style>` elements. `blob:` is allowed for media and images (HLS.js plays through a MediaSource URL). A self-hosted install gets the same policy without Clerk, Cloudflare and Stripe. The API docs pages set their own looser policy, because Swagger UI and ReDoc load from jsdelivr. **If the frontend starts loading anything from a new origin, add it to the policy, or the browser will block it silently.**

## Errors

- Most errors are `{"detail": "message"}`. Newer endpoints use `ApiError`'s structured form, `{"detail": {"error": "code", "message": "…", …}}`.
- Validation failures are **422** with `{"detail": {"error": "validation_failed", "message": "…", "errors": [{type, loc, msg, input}]}}` (`query.rs`). Undeclared fields in a JSON body are refused, not ignored, where ignoring would be unsafe (`/api/mcp/keys`). A NUL character anywhere in a JSON body is a 422.
- Rate limits are **429** with `Retry-After` and `{"error": "rate_limit_exceeded", "message", "limit", "retry_after_seconds"}`.
- An unexpected failure is a 500 whose detail is logged once, as an error, so it reaches Sentry.
- The frontend's `services/api.js::parseErrorBody` understands all of these shapes. MCP tools answer with a tool error instead, because JSON-RPC fixes its own error shape.

## Two databases

PostgreSQL in production; SQLite is the self-hosted default. **The driver is chosen at build time** (`--features sqlite`); `src/db.rs` explains why. The image carries both builds, and `sentinel-command` replaces itself with `sentinel-command-sqlite` when `DATABASE_URL` is a `sqlite://` URL, so the URL is the only choice an operator makes.

- **Schema.** `migrations/0001_adopt_production_schema.sql` is production's `pg_dump --schema-only`, not a transcription. `migrations-sqlite/` is what the old Python models produced on SQLite, so a `sentinel.db` from the last Python release opens unchanged. Both are applied at start-up by `sqlx::migrate!`. History: [ADR 0001](/command/docs/adr/0001-sync-schema-vs-alembic.md).
- **Pragmas (SQLite).** WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, 30-second `busy_timeout`, foreign keys on.
- **Pool (PostgreSQL).** 10 connections, 10-second acquire timeout.
- **Queries** are runtime-checked (`sqlx::query*`), not the compile-time macros, so building needs no database.

**Writing SQL that runs on both** (full list in [backend-rs/README.md](https://github.com/SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-Command/blob/master/backend-rs/README.md#two-databases)):

- `CAST(x AS TEXT)`, never `x::text`.
- Every `ORDER BY` over a nullable column says `NULLS LAST` or `NULLS FIRST`; the engines sort NULL at opposite ends, and a unit test enforces it.
- Bind times from Rust (`now_naive()`), not `now()`.
- Lists use `db::any` / `db::list`; case-insensitive matching uses `db::ILIKE`.
- Serialise check-then-write races with a conditional `UPDATE`, or with `db::lock_for_update(tx, key)` (a transaction-scoped advisory lock on PostgreSQL; SQLite's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` already serialises writers).

**Production database.** One shared Fly Postgres cluster, `sentinel-postgres`, holds one database per service: `sentinel_command`, `sentinel_license` and `sentinel_sync`. Each database is owned by its own role, `CONNECT` is revoked from `PUBLIC`, and no role is a superuser. **`fly postgres attach` creates a superuser role**, so any future attach must be re-hardened ([DISASTER_RECOVERY.md](/command/docs/runbooks/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md)).

## Authentication

Six kinds of credential. Each has its own scope and its own way to revoke it.

| Credential | Used by | Checked by | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clerk session JWT | browsers (hosted) | `auth.rs` | one user in one org, with role |
| Local JWT | browser (self-hosted) | `auth/local.rs` | the single admin |
| Node API key (`X-Node-API-Key`) | CameraNodes | `api/node_register.rs` | one node |
| MCP key (`Bearer osc_…`) | Claude and other MCP clients | `mcp/auth.rs` | one org; scope `all`, `readonly` or `custom` |
| Integration key (`Bearer osi_…`) | Home Assistant | `api/integration.rs` | one org, `/api/integration/*` only |
| Agent key (`osa_…`, or the shared `SENTINEL_AGENT_KEY`) | the Sentinel AI agent | `api/sentinel.rs`, `mcp/auth.rs` | `osa_`: one org. Shared key: every org |

Node, MCP, integration and `osa_` keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes and shown in full once, at creation.

### Clerk (hosted)

The token comes from `Authorization: Bearer`, or else the Clerk session cookie. It is verified locally against a cached JWKS (RS256), with no Clerk SDK and no network call per request. Checks: issuer, expiry, not-before (5 s leeway), and **`azp` must equal `FRONTEND_URL` exactly**. `org_id`, role and permissions come from the claims, in either Clerk's V1 or V2 (`o`, `fea`) format (`auth/claims.rs`).

- **`RequireView`**: any member of the org.
- **`RequireAdmin`**: role `org:admin` / `admin`, or the `org:cameras:manage_cameras` permission.
- **`RequireActiveBilling`**: admin, and the org not past due.

A 401 from any API call makes the frontend end the Clerk session and return to `/sign-in`.

### Local auth (self-hosted)

`AUTH_PROVIDER=local` replaces Clerk with one admin account and one org (`LOCAL_ORG_ID`). Both produce the same `AuthUser`, so every route and plan check works unchanged.

- **Login.** `POST /api/auth/local/login` checks `LOCAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and the argon2 `LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (from `sentinel-hash-password`, whose parameters match python-argon2's), and returns a 30-day HS256 token signed with `APP_SECRET_KEY`. It is limited to 10 attempts a minute **per client address**, whatever credentials the request carries (`PerMinuteByIp`).
- **Refresh.** `POST /api/auth/local/refresh` re-signs a valid token, so an open dashboard never hits the 30-day wall.
- **Plan.** Every plan lookup short-circuits to the `self_host` tier. Everything is unlocked except Sentinel AI, which needs a licence.
- **Not available:** the Clerk webhook route is not mounted, the hourly plan reconcile does not run, and email recipients are just `LOCAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
- **Frontend.** `frontend/src/auth/` is a facade: with `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER=local` it supplies a local stand-in for Clerk's hooks, so pages need not know which mode is active.
- This login is unrelated to a CameraNode's own local-dashboard password.

### Self-hosted licence and cloud sync

- **Licence.** `license.rs` checks `SENTINEL_LICENSE_KEY` with Sentinel-License-Service at start-up and every 15 minutes, caching the verdict in `settings` rows. If the service is unreachable, the last good verdict holds for **72 hours**. If it answers "no", access ends at once. One predicate, `license::sentinel_blocked_by_license`, gates Sentinel AI wherever the plan does: dispatch, the manual run, the Sentinel config API, and agent MCP auth.
- **Cloud sync.** A second entitlement on the same licence (`sync_enabled`). `sync.rs` pushes changed rows to Sentinel-Sync-Service every 30 minutes, keyset-paged on `(timestamp, id)` with a 10-second settle window, so a slow commit is never skipped. Payloads are raw column values. The exceptions: `camera_nodes.api_key_hash` and `incident_evidence.data` are never sent. Deletions propagate only for cameras, groups and nodes; log tables keep history the local install has pruned. Recovery is `sentinel-restore-from-cloud` ([DISASTER_RECOVERY.md](/command/docs/runbooks/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md#self-hosted-installs-restoring-from-the-cloud-mirror)).

### Node keys

The key's SHA-256 is matched against `camera_nodes.api_key_hash`, and the org comes from the node row. A wrong key at `/register` or `/validate` records "Invalid API key" on the node only if it has **never connected**. Node IDs are not secret, so on a working node that note would let anyone tell an org to rotate a good key.

### Deleting an account (hosted)

`api/account.rs`. "Delete account" in the account menu opens `/account/delete`; Clerk's own delete button is hidden (`profileSection__danger` in the Clerk appearance), so every deletion goes through the app. Per organization, the account is either the only member (the org is deleted with it), one of several with another admin remaining (it just leaves), or the only admin with other members (refused until someone else is made admin). Then the account is deleted at Clerk and its data erased. These two routes use `SignedInUser`, which needs a valid Clerk session but not an active organization, so someone who has left every org can still delete themselves. The `user.deleted` webhook runs the same erasure as a backstop.

### MCP and integration keys

Both live in `mcp_api_keys`, split by `kind` (`mcp` or `integration`). **Every query filters on `kind`**, so neither kind works on the other's surface. Integration keys work on every plan.

## Data model

21 tables (`migrations/0001_adopt_production_schema.sql`). Every table has `org_id` except `processed_webhooks` (webhook dedup, keyed on the Svix message id) and `email_suppression` (one bounce/complaint list for every org), which are cross-tenant by design.

| Table | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `cameras` | a camera: node, name, status, codecs, group, recording policy, `disabled_by_plan`, `last_seen` |
| `camera_nodes` | a CameraNode: `api_key_hash`, hostname, status, version, storage stats, `last_register_error` |
| `camera_groups` | user-defined groups (name, colour, icon) |
| `settings` | per-org key/value: plan, timezone, notification toggles, payment flags, licence verdict, sync cursors, cooldown anchors |
| `audit_log` | security audit trail |
| `stream_access_logs` | who watched which camera, when, from where |
| `mcp_api_keys` | MCP (`osc_`) and integration (`osi_`) keys; `scope_mode`, `scope_tools` |
| `mcp_activity_logs` | one row per MCP tool call |
| `sentinel_agent_keys` | per-org agent keys (`osa_`) |
| `sentinel_config` | per-org Sentinel AI settings; created on first read, switched **off** (the Privacy Policy promises it is off until an admin turns it on) |
| `sentinel_runs` | one row per agent run: trigger, outcome, severity, incident, tool trace |
| `incidents` | title, summary, markdown report, severity, status (`open`, `acknowledged`, `resolved`, `dismissed`) |
| `incident_evidence` | snapshot (JPEG), clip (MPEG-TS) or text observation; bytes stored inline |
| `motion_events` | motion reported by CameraNode (score 0–100) |
| `notifications` | the inbox (see [Notifications and email](#notifications-and-email)) |
| `user_notification_state` | each user's read cursor |
| `org_monthly_usage` | viewer-seconds per org per month |
| `email_outbox` | queued emails, drained by the worker |
| `email_log` | per-org email audit |
| `email_suppression` | addresses never to mail again (cross-tenant) |
| `processed_webhooks` | Clerk and Resend webhook dedup (cross-tenant) |

## API routes

**`backend-rs/src/app.rs` is the authoritative list.** Auth levels: *view* = any org member, *admin* = org admin, *billing* = admin and not past due. Rate limits are per minute unless marked `/h`. HLS `GET`s are not rate limited; they are metered against viewer-hours.

### Cameras, groups and settings

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/cameras`, `/api/cameras/{id}` | view | |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/snapshot`: the node captures and stores a snapshot | view | 30 |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/recording`: start/stop (flips `continuous_24_7`) | admin | 30 |
| PATCH | `/api/cameras/{id}/recording-settings`: continuous / scheduled window | admin | 30 |
| GET / POST | `/api/camera-groups` | view / admin | – / 20 |
| DELETE | `/api/camera-groups/{id}`: its cameras are unassigned | admin | 60 |
| PUT | `/api/cameras/{id}/group` | admin | 60 |
| GET | `/api/settings`, `/api/settings/notifications`, `/api/settings/motion-ingestion` | view | |
| POST | `/api/settings/notifications`, `/api/settings/motion-ingestion`, `/api/settings/timezone` | admin | 30 |
| POST | `/api/settings/danger/wipe-logs`: delete stream and MCP logs | admin | 5/h |
| POST | `/api/settings/danger/full-reset`: GDPR erasure of all org data | admin | 3/h |
| POST | `/api/gdpr/export`: a ZIP of every org table as JSON, plus each incident's images and clips under `evidence/` (built in a temporary file, not in memory) | admin | 3/h |
| GET | `/api/audit-logs`, `/api/audit/stream-logs`, `/api/audit/stream-logs/stats` | admin | 120 / 120 / 60 |

`/api/audit-logs`, `/api/audit/stream-logs` and `/api/mcp/activity/logs` also answer `?format=csv`, streamed (`csv_export.rs`). String cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR are prefixed with `'` so spreadsheets don't run them as formulas.

### Nodes (CameraNode)

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/nodes/validate`: check a node ID and key pair (setup wizard) | node key | 10 |
| POST | `/api/nodes/register`: register cameras, report version | node key | 10 |
| POST | `/api/nodes/heartbeat` | node key | 60 |
| POST | `/api/nodes/self/decommission`: the node deletes itself before a local wipe | node key | 10/h |
| GET | `/ws/node`: WebSocket (see below) | node key | |
| GET | `/api/nodes`, `/api/nodes/{id}`, `/api/nodes/ws-status` | admin | |
| GET | `/api/nodes/plan`: plan, usage and limits | view | |
| POST | `/api/nodes`: create a node, returns its key once | billing | 20/h |
| DELETE | `/api/nodes/{id}`: deletes its cameras and caches | admin | 20/h |
| POST | `/api/nodes/{id}/rotate-key` | admin | 5 |
| POST | `/api/nodes/{id}/storage-cap`: body `{max_size_gb}`; sent to the node as `set_storage_cap` (CameraNode 0.1.79+) | admin | 10 |

**WebSocket `/ws/node`.** The node authenticates with `X-Node-API-Key` and `X-Node-Id` headers; an old `?api_key=&node_id=` query string still works but logs a deprecation warning. Node → backend messages are `heartbeat` and `command_result`. Backend → node messages are `ack`, `command` (`take_snapshot`, `list_snapshots`, `list_recordings`, `wipe_data`, `set_storage_cap`) and `error`. A node too old to know a command answers `unknown command: …`; `set_storage_cap` turns that into a 409 telling the admin to update. Any other message type gets an `error` frame, and frames containing a NUL are refused. Motion never travels over the socket.

### Live video (HLS)

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/cameras/{id}/stream.m3u8`, `/api/cameras/{id}/segment/{file}` | any signed-in member | viewer-hours |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/push-segment?filename=…` | node key | 1200 |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/playlist` | node key | 600 |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/codec` | node key | 30 |
| POST | `/api/cameras/{id}/motion`: a no-op answer when the org has motion ingestion off | node key | 120 |

### Incidents

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/incidents` (filters: `status`, `severity`, `camera_id`, `limit`, `offset`), `/api/incidents/counts`, `/api/incidents/{id}` | admin | |
| POST | `/api/incidents` | admin | 60 |
| PATCH / DELETE | `/api/incidents/{id}`: deleting removes its evidence | admin | 120 / 60 |
| GET | `/api/incidents/{id}/evidence/{eid}`, `…/playlist.m3u8` (single-segment clip playback) | admin | 120 |

### Motion and notifications

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/motion/events`, `/api/motion/events/stats` | view | |
| GET | `/api/motion/events/stream` (SSE) | view | 60 |
| GET | `/api/notifications`, `/api/notifications/unread-count` (capped at 99) | view | |
| GET | `/api/notifications/stream` (SSE) | view | 60 |
| POST | `/api/notifications/mark-viewed`, `/api/notifications/clear-all`: a per-user cursor; deletes nothing | view | |
| POST | `/api/notifications/request-admin-promotion` | view | 3/h |
| GET / POST | `/api/notifications/email/preferences` | view / admin | |
| GET | `/api/notifications/email/unsubscribe?t=…`: signed one-click link; returns an HTML page | signed token | 60 |

Members never see `audience = "admin"` notifications, in the list, the count or the stream.

### Sentinel AI

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/sentinel/config`: always 200; non-eligible orgs get a read-only payload | view | |
| PATCH | `/api/sentinel/config` | admin + eligible plan | |
| GET | `/api/sentinel/runs`, `/api/sentinel/runs/{id}` | view | |
| POST | `/api/sentinel/runs/manual`: "Run now" (skips schedule and scope, not the cap; 409 `sentinel_off` while Sentinel is off) | admin + eligible plan | |
| GET / POST | `/api/sentinel/agent-keys`: issue a per-org `osa_` key | admin / billing | – / 10/h |
| DELETE | `/api/sentinel/agent-keys/{id}` | admin | 30/h |
| GET | `/api/sentinel/runs/pending`: oldest first | agent key | |
| POST | `/api/sentinel/runs/{id}/start`: claim, `pending → running`; exactly one caller wins | agent key | |
| POST | `/api/sentinel/runs/{id}/complete`: `incident`, `no_action` or `error`, plus the tool trace | agent key | |

`/complete` is idempotent: a finished run cannot be changed, except that an `error` (for example, from the reaper) can still be upgraded to a real outcome. An `incident_id` is accepted only if it belongs to the run's org.

### Keys, MCP activity and integrations

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET / POST | `/api/mcp/keys`: body `{name, scope_mode, scope_tools?}`; any other field is a 422 | admin / billing | – / 10/h |
| DELETE | `/api/mcp/keys/{id}` | admin | 30/h |
| GET | `/api/mcp/tools`: the tool catalog with read/write kind | admin | |
| GET | `/api/mcp/activity/{recent,sessions,stats}` | admin | |
| GET | `/api/mcp/activity/logs`, `…/logs/stats` | admin | 120 / 60 |
| GET | `/api/mcp/activity/stream` (SSE) | admin | 60 |
| GET / POST / DELETE | `/api/integration/keys`, `/api/integration/keys/{id}` | admin | – / 10/h / 30/h |
| GET | `/api/integration/cameras`: with LAN `local_url` and recording state | `osi_` key | 120 |

| POST | `/api/integration/cameras/{id}/recording`: body `{recording: bool}` | `osi_` key | 60 |
| GET | `/api/integration/status`: camera and node counts, disk, versions, plan | `osi_` key | 120 |
| GET | `/api/integration/motion/stream` (SSE; its own subscriber pool) | `osi_` key | 60 |

### Auth, webhooks, health and public files

| Method | Path | Auth | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/auth/local/login` | – | 10 per address |
| POST | `/api/auth/local/refresh` | local JWT | 30 |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/clerk` | Svix signature | 120 |
| GET | `/api/account/deletion`: what deleting your account would do, per organization | signed in (no org needed) | 30 |
| DELETE | `/api/account`: delete your account; body `{"confirm": "delete my account"}`. 409 if you are the last admin of an org with other members | signed in (no org needed) | 5/h |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/resend` | Svix signature | 600 |
| GET | `/api/health`: `{"status":"healthy","version":"2.1.2"}`, no database work | – | |
| GET | `/api/health/ready`: 503 if a critical probe fails | – | |
| GET | `/api/health/detailed`: database latency, cache, SSE and usage counters. Public; metric-shaped only, never an identifier | – | |
| GET | `/install.sh` (CameraNode installer, Linux/macOS), `/mcp-setup.sh`, `/mcp-setup.ps1` | – | 30 |
| GET | `/downloads/{os}/{arch}`: 302 to the matching CameraNode release asset | – | 60 |
| GET | `/.well-known/security.txt`, `/security.txt` | – | |
| GET | `/api-docs`, `/api-redoc`, `/api/openapi.json` (off under Fly) | – | |
| POST | `/mcp/`: the MCP server | MCP or agent key | 600 |

## MCP server

`/mcp/` serves the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) through rmcp's streamable-HTTP transport, stateless, answering in JSON. Before any request reaches it, `mcp/pre_auth.rs` requires `Content-Length`, caps the body at 2 MB and limits callers to 600 requests a minute. rmcp's DNS-rebinding guard is **off** (`app.rs`): its default allows only a localhost `Host`, which would refuse every real client, and every call carries a key anyway.

**The scope gate** (`mcp/scope.rs`, applied in `mcp/server.rs`) runs before `tools/list` and every `tools/call`:

- It looks the bearer key up and computes the allowed tools from the key's `scope_mode`: `all` (or NULL) is every tool; `readonly` is the 16 read tools; `custom` is the intersection of `scope_tools` with the real tool list, so a typo cannot enable anything.
- Agent keys (`osa_` and the shared key) get the **agent allowlist**: every tool except `set_camera_recording_policy`, because an agent steered by what a camera sees must not be able to turn the camera off.
- A key it does not recognise (missing, mistyped, revoked) gets a JSON-RPC error, even for `tools/list`. It is not an HTTP 401, because in MCP a 401 sends clients into OAuth discovery.
- Tool arguments containing a NUL are refused. Every call is logged to `mcp_activity_logs`, including refused ones.
- Rate limits per key: Pro 30/minute and 5,000/day; Pro Plus and self-hosted 120/minute and 30,000/day. Free plans have no MCP access.

**Tools (23).**

| Read (16) | Write (7) |
| --- | --- |
| `list_cameras`, `get_camera`, `get_stream_url`, `view_camera` (live JPEG), `watch_camera` (2–10 frames, 1–30 s apart), `list_camera_groups`, `list_nodes`, `get_node`, `get_camera_recording_policy`, `get_stream_logs`, `get_stream_stats`, `get_system_status`, `list_incidents`, `get_incident`, `get_incident_snapshot`, `get_incident_clip` | `create_incident`, `add_observation`, `attach_snapshot`, `attach_clip` (from the live cache), `update_incident`, `finalize_incident`, `set_camera_recording_policy` |

`limit` arguments are clamped to 1–500 and `offset` to 0 or more. Live frames come from the node over the WebSocket (`mcp/snapshot.rs`), so `view_camera` needs a connected node.

## Plans and limits

`plans.rs` is the source of truth. Three hosted tiers, plus `self_host` for local-auth installs.

| | Free (`free_org`) | Pro (`pro`) | Pro Plus (`pro_plus`) | Self-hosted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cameras | 5 | 25 | 200 | 999 |
| Nodes | 2 | 10 | 999 | 999 |
| Seats | 2 | 10 | 20 | 1 |
| **Viewer-hours per month** | 30 | 300 | 1,500 | unlimited (999,999) |
| Live (SSE) connections per stream type | 10 | 30 | 100 | 50 |
| Log retention | 30 days | 90 days | 365 days | 365 days |
| Sentinel AI runs per month | – | 100 | 500 | 500 (with licence) |
| MCP | – | 30/min, 5k/day | 120/min, 30k/day | 120/min, 30k/day |

- **Viewer-hours are the real tier axis** ([ADR 0002](/command/docs/adr/0002-viewer-hour-billing.md)). Each served segment adds a second to an in-memory counter. The counter is flushed to `org_monthly_usage` every 60 seconds, so the hot path never waits on the database. Past the cap, segment requests get 429 with `Retry-After: 3600`. `GET /api/nodes/plan` reports the usage.
- **Plan resolution.** `resolve_org_plan` reads the `org_plan` setting and falls back to Clerk for orgs without one. `effective_plan_for_caps` returns `free_org` instead once an org has been past due for more than **7 days**. Short card failures don't punish anyone; long-unpaid accounts lose Pro limits.
- **Camera cap.** `enforce_camera_cap` keeps the oldest N cameras and flags the rest `disabled_by_plan`. Upgrading clears the flags in the same call. It runs on subscription webhooks, on every registration, and on heartbeats while an org is past due.
- **Sentinel AI** is available on Pro, Pro Plus and licensed self-hosted installs. Caps reset on the 1st of each month (UTC). At the cap, dispatch pauses, and nothing else is affected.

## Webhooks

Both endpoints verify a Svix signature and dedupe on the Svix message ID (`processed_webhooks`), so retries are harmless.

**`POST /api/webhooks/clerk`** (refused when `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset):

| Event | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `subscription.created` / `updated` / `active`, `subscriptionItem.active` | store `org_plan`, set the org's Clerk member limit, `enforce_camera_cap` (`subscriptionItem.active` on a paid plan also clears past-due) |
| `subscription.pastDue`, `subscriptionItem.pastDue` | set `payment_past_due` and its timestamp (the 7-day grace starts) |
| `paymentAttempt.updated` with `status=paid` | clear past-due, `enforce_camera_cap` |
| `subscriptionItem.canceled` / `ended` | back to `free_org`, `enforce_camera_cap` (cameras are kept, not deleted) |
| `subscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding` | logged only |
| `organization.created` | `welcome` notification |
| `organization.deleted` | erase all the org's data (the same function as full-reset) |
| `organizationMembership.created` / `updated` / `deleted` | `member_added` / `member_role_changed` / `member_removed` notification for admins. On `deleted`, an organization left with no members is deleted at Clerk (which sends `organization.deleted`) |
| `user.deleted` | erase that person's data in every org (`gdpr::erase_user_data`): viewing history and read cursors deleted, email log and queue rows deleted, audit rows and "created by" labels kept but anonymised |

Clerk only sends what the endpoint subscribes to. Its configuration is in the Clerk dashboard (Webhooks); the event list is in [LAUNCH_HANDOFF.md](/command/docs/LAUNCH_HANDOFF.md).

**`POST /api/webhooks/resend`**: `email.bounced` and `email.complained` add the address to `email_suppression`, and the worker never mails it again, for any org.

## Background loops

Started from `main.rs`. All are `tokio` tasks in the `app` process.

| Loop | Where | Every | Does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offline sweep | `loops.rs` | 30 s | Nodes and cameras silent for 90 s go `offline`, with a notification each. |
| Log cleanup | `loops.rs` | 24 h | Deletes logs older than each org's retention; terminal outbox rows after 7 days; webhook dedup markers after 30 days. |
| Sentinel reaper | `loops.rs` | 5 min | `running` runs older than 20 min become `error`; `pending` runs unclaimed for 2 min re-fire the wakeup; after 6 h they are abandoned. |
| Motion digest | `loops.rs` | 60 s | Closes each camera's motion-email cooldown and sends one digest for what happened inside it. |
| Disk check | `loops.rs` | 5 min | At 95 % full, one `tracing::error!` (a Sentry alert) per 6 h. Operator-only: never a customer notification. |
| Plan reconcile | `loops.rs` | 1 h | Clerk mode only: re-reads plans from Clerk in case a webhook was missed. |
| Licence check-in | `loops.rs` | 15 min | Local mode with a licence key. |
| Cloud sync | `loops.rs` | 30 min | Local mode with the sync entitlement. |
| Viewer-usage flush | `hls.rs` | 60 s | Writes viewer-seconds to `org_monthly_usage`. |
| Stale-camera eviction | `hls.rs` | 60 s | Drops caches of cameras that stopped pushing. |
| Release refresh | `versions.rs` | 10 min | Fetches the latest CameraNode release for "update available". |
| Email worker | `email_worker.rs` | 5 s | Drains the outbox; checks suppression first; reclaims rows stuck sending for 60 s; Resend idempotency keys prevent duplicates. |

## Notifications and email

`notifications.rs::create_notification` writes an inbox row (unless the org turned that kind off), broadcasts it to SSE subscribers, and queues an email if the kind's email toggle is on.

**Kinds:** `motion`, `motion_digest`, `camera_online`, `camera_offline`, `node_online`, `node_offline`, `incident_created`, `mcp_key_created`, `mcp_key_revoked`, `sentinel_agent_key_created`, `sentinel_agent_key_revoked`, `cameranode_disk_low`, `member_added`, `member_role_changed`, `member_removed`, `member_promotion_requested`, `welcome`. Each has an inbox toggle; most have an email toggle.

- **Transitions.** A camera or node is announced going offline from any non-offline state, and coming back online only from `offline`. A camera that is `streaming` counts as online. Register, HTTP heartbeat, WebSocket heartbeat and the sweep all follow this one rule.
- **Motion email** has a per-camera cooldown: the first event emails at once, and later ones within the window become one digest. The cooldown claim is not atomic, so two simultaneous first events can each send a mail. That is accepted: a duplicate beats a lost alert.
- **Email** goes through the `email_outbox` table, so it survives restarts. Templates are minijinja with autoescape, compiled in. Unsubscribe links carry a signed token, derived from `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (or `APP_SECRET_KEY` in local mode).

## Conventions

- **Tenant isolation.** Every query is scoped by the `org_id` of the authenticated credential. The two-org isolation check (every route, MCP tool, node route and WebSocket message, aimed at another org's IDs) passes.
- **Key order is on the wire.** `serde_json` uses `preserve_order`. `Map::remove` is then a *swap*-remove; use `shift_remove`.
- **Validation lives in `query.rs`**, which reproduces FastAPI's 422 shape and parameter order. Use its helpers rather than serde's rejection, which would answer 400.
- **Races** are closed with a conditional `UPDATE` or `db::lock_for_update`, not check-then-write.
- **Errors that reach Sentry** are `tracing::error!`. Don't log expected refusals at ERROR.
- **Tests** live beside the code (`src/**`) and in `backend-rs/tests/`. Anything touching the database gets a `*_db.rs` test, which runs on PostgreSQL with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and always under `--features sqlite`.
- **Frontend**: `useSharedToken` shares the Clerk token with HLS.js; `HeartbeatBanner` polls a new node until its first heartbeat; `WelcomeHero.jsx` shows admins a setup checklist and members a capability tour.

## History: the Rust rewrite

The backend was Python (FastAPI) and the agent a Python worker (LiteLLM and the MCP SDK) until the rewrite. It merged to `master` on 2026-10-05 (PR #348). The port was a strangler: Rust took the port first and proxied what it had not yet absorbed, and each slice was checked against the running Python before it moved.

- **Verification.** `backend-rs/tests/differential/` ran both stacks against one database and compared responses **and** table contents. The final run before the Python was deleted: reads 592/592, writes 729/729, MCP 150/150, background loops 7/7, SSE 29/29, HLS 49/49, WebSocket 20/20, plans 34/34. The agent was compared on all three provider wires (Ollama 20/20, OpenAI 15/15, Anthropic 12/12).
- **The record.** Those harnesses stay in the tree as the record and run against the commit before the deletion. [backend-rs/README.md](https://github.com/SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-Command/blob/master/backend-rs/README.md) says what replaced them.
- **Bugs found along the way.** `backend-rs/PYTHON_BUGS.md` lists the Python bugs the port found. Most were fixed in Rust once the two no longer had to agree.

After the merge, the live production check (2026-10-05) confirmed the following on `app.sentinel-command.com` with a real Clerk user:

- sign-in and every main API read;
- node registration, video push and dashboard playback;
- a snapshot over `wss://`;
- incidents and notifications;
- Clerk's `organization.deleted` webhook erasing an org.

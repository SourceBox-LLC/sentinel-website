# Disaster recovery — Sentinel Command Center

> **Audience:** the operator restoring service after the database is
> lost, corrupted, or the machine/volume is gone.
> **Goal:** get back to a known-good database with the least data loss
> and the least chance of compounding the damage.

This is the runbook `ON_CALL.md` deliberately doesn't cover: not "the
app is slow" but **"the data is gone."** Everything customer-facing —
accounts, cameras, nodes, incidents, MCP keys, audit logs, and the
`Setting(org_plan)` row that links an org to its paid plan — lives in
the **`sentinel_command` database on the managed `sentinel-postgres`
Postgres cluster**. Recovery is **restore from a backup**, so the backup
must exist and the restore must have been rehearsed.

## Start here — which situation is this?

| Situation | Go to |
| --------- | ----- |
| The hosted database is lost, corrupted, or wrong | [Restore procedure](#restore-procedure) |
| A machine or volume is gone | [Restore procedure](#restore-procedure) |
| A **self-hosted** customer lost their local database | [Restoring from the cloud mirror](#self-hosted-installs-restoring-from-the-cloud-mirror) |
| You need to know whether a backup even exists | [Backups: how they're produced](#backups-how-theyre-produced) |
| Nothing is broken — you're preparing | [The one thing to do before launch](#the-one-thing-to-do-before-launch) · [Rehearsal drill](#rehearsal-drill-do-this-before-launch-then-quarterly) |
| The service is broken but the **data is fine** | [ON_CALL.md](/command/docs/runbooks/ON_CALL.md) — not this file |

**Before you restore anything:** a restore is destructive and a wrong one compounds the damage. Read the whole [Restore procedure](#restore-procedure) section before running its first command.


## Where the data lives

- **The database** is `sentinel_command` on **`sentinel-postgres`**, a Fly Postgres cluster that holds one database per service: `sentinel_command`, `sentinel_license` and `sentinel_sync`. `DATABASE_URL` is a Fly **secret** (it carries a password). A secret always wins over `fly.toml`, so check `fly secrets list` before believing the config file.
- **The `sentinel_data` volume** (`/data` on the `app` machine) holds HLS working files and `/data/backups`. It does **not** hold the database, so losing the volume does not lose data.
- **The cluster is one node with no replica**, by decision (2026-09-07). A replica buys uptime, not durability, and durability is covered by snapshots plus portable dumps with a rehearsed restore. The cost: a cluster failure is **downtime for all three services** until Fly restarts the machine or someone restores a snapshot. There is no failover and nothing to promote; plan for minutes, not seconds. `fly machine clone -a sentinel-postgres` adds a standby if that trade ever changes.
- **Every backup lives inside Fly**, by decision (2026-09-07). `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` are deliberately unset. Snapshots plus dumps cover a bad migration, an accidental delete and losing the cluster. Losing the Fly account itself is the accepted risk, so keep its billing current and its login secured. Turning on an off-platform copy needs only a secret, no code.

### Each service can reach only its own database

`fly postgres attach` creates every role as a Postgres **superuser**. On a shared cluster, that would let one leaked `DATABASE_URL` read and write all three databases, including `sentinel_sync`, which holds self-hosted customers' mirrored data. The roles are hardened instead:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE sentinel_command OWNER TO sentinel_command;
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE sentinel_command FROM PUBLIC;
ALTER ROLE sentinel_command NOSUPERUSER;
```

Move ownership **before** dropping superuser. The database is created owned by `postgres`, so a bare `NOSUPERUSER` takes away the app's right to create tables and its start-up migrations fail. Verified on the real cluster: all six cross-database connection attempts are refused, each service reaches its own, and no service role is a superuser.

⚠️ **Any future `fly postgres attach` recreates a superuser role.** Re-run the three statements for that database and re-verify.

---

## The one thing to do before launch

**Run a real restore drill once, end to end, before onboarding the
first paying customer.** A backup you have never restored is a guess,
not a backup. The drill is in the last section — do it now, not during
an incident.

---

## Backups: how they're produced

There are **two independent layers**, and it matters which one you reach
for:

1. **Managed cluster snapshots — the primary.** Fly takes these on the
   `sentinel-postgres` cluster automatically. They are the fastest path
   back and the one that covers "the cluster is gone". Check them with
   `fly volumes list -a sentinel-postgres` and
   `fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id>`.
2. **`scripts/backup_db.sh` — the portable secondary.** Runs
   `pg_dump --format=custom` (compressed; restorable *selectively* with
   `pg_restore`, not just all-or-nothing), verifies the result by
   reading its table of contents back with `pg_restore --list`,
   optionally uploads off-platform, and prunes old local copies. This is
   the layer that restores onto **any** Postgres anywhere — a different
   provider, a laptop — which is exactly what a Fly account loss needs.

| Env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | _(required)_ | source DB — read from the machine's own env, so there is no second copy of the credential to drift |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `/data/backups` | local destination |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` | local prune window |
| `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` | _(unset)_ | off-platform target, e.g. `s3://bucket/cc` (needs `aws` CLI + creds) |

**Every copy lives inside Fly, by choice** (see [Where the data lives](#where-the-data-lives)):

| Copy | Where | Kept for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cluster snapshots (primary) | Fly | 5 days, daily |
| Portable `pg_dump` (secondary) | `/data/backups` on the app's volume | 14 days, daily |
| Encrypted GitHub artifact | GitHub | off (`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` unset) |
| S3 | elsewhere | off (`BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` unset) |

So you can go back up to 5 days with a snapshot, or 14 days with a dump.

**Two gotchas the scripts handle for you, worth knowing before you run
`pg_dump` by hand:**

- `DATABASE_URL` may still carry a `+psycopg` suffix
  (`postgresql+psycopg://…`), the form the Python era used. **libpq does
  not understand it** and fails with an unhelpful "invalid URI". The
  scripts strip it, and so does the backend.
- `pg_dump` **refuses** to dump a server whose major version is newer
  than its own ("aborting because of server version mismatch"). The
  cluster is 18.x and Debian bookworm ships client 15, so the Dockerfile
  pins `postgresql-client-18` from PGDG. If you dump from your laptop,
  check `pg_dump --version` first.

### Schedule it — WIRED: `.github/workflows/backup.yml`

A scheduled GitHub Action runs daily (09:17 UTC, plus manual
`workflow_dispatch`):

1. Executes `bash /app/scripts/backup_db.sh` on the Fly machine (the
   Dockerfile copies the repo's `scripts/` to `/app/scripts/`). It runs *on the
   machine* so `DATABASE_URL` never has to be copied into GitHub
   secrets. Dumps land in `/data/backups` with 14-day pruning.
2. **Off-platform copy** — if the `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` repo secret is
   set, the workflow pulls the newest dump, encrypts it with
   AES-256-CBC/PBKDF2, and stores it as a GitHub Actions artifact
   (30-day retention). The repo is public, so ONLY ciphertext is ever
   uploaded; without the key the workflow warns and stays local-only.
   Decrypt with:

   ```bash
   openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 \
     -in backup.dump.enc -out backup.dump -pass pass:<key>
   ```

   This path is **off by decision** (2026-09-07) — see the note near the
   top. If it is ever turned back on: `openssl rand -hex 32` → repo
   secret `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` → **store the same key in your
   password manager**, because an encrypted backup with a lost key is
   no backup.
3. Prints the cluster's snapshot list for visibility.

`BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` on the Fly app remains the alternative/additional
off-platform target supported by the script itself.

**Sentinel-License-Service has its own identical job** in that repo
(`.github/workflows/backup.yml`, 09:47 UTC). Its database is on the same
cluster; the two are separate databases with separate dumps. If you
change one workflow, change the other.

---

## Restore procedure

`scripts/restore_db.sh` makes this executable. It **verifies the
dump is readable before touching anything**, dumps the current database
to a `pre-restore-<stamp>.dump` rollback point, then restores with
`pg_restore --clean --if-exists`.

> ⚠️ **This is destructive in a way the SQLite version was not.** That
> script moved a file aside; a live Postgres has no such move, so the
> rollback point has to be *created* — which is why step 2 exists and why
> the script prompts for a typed confirmation unless you pass `--yes`.

**Stop writes first.** Restoring under a live writer gives you a mix of
old and new rows.

```bash
# 1. Stop the app so nothing writes during the restore.
fly status -a sentinel-command                 # note the machine id
fly machine stop <machine-id> -a sentinel-command

# 2. Get a dump onto the machine (if restoring from S3 or an artifact).
fly ssh console -a sentinel-command
#   inside the machine:
#   aws s3 cp s3://bucket/cc/sentinel-<stamp>.dump /data/backups/

# 3. Restore (verifies the dump, writes a rollback point, prompts).
bash /app/scripts/restore_db.sh /data/backups/sentinel-<stamp>.dump

# 4. Start the app and verify BEFORE deleting the pre-restore dump.
exit
fly machine start <machine-id> -a sentinel-command
curl -fsS https://app.sentinel-command.com/api/health/ready
```

Then sanity-check in the dashboard: an org loads, cameras list, a known
incident is present, and a paid org still shows its plan. Only after
that, remove `/data/backups/pre-restore-<stamp>.dump`.

**Restoring into a fresh database instead** (preferred when you want the
old one kept for comparison): create a database on the cluster, point
`DATABASE_URL` at it, restore, then flip the app's secret over. The
dumps are taken `--no-owner --no-privileges` precisely so they restore
somewhere the original roles don't exist.

### If the cluster is gone

1. Provision a new Postgres cluster and create the `sentinel_command`
   database and role on it.
2. Restore the newest dump into it (`restore_db.sh`, or `pg_restore`
   directly from a laptop with a client ≥ the cluster's major version).
3. Point the app at it: `fly secrets set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… -a sentinel-command`.
   `postgres://` and `postgresql://` both work.
4. If the app machine/volume is *also* gone, recreate them
   (`fly volumes create sentinel_data …`, then `fly deploy`) — the
   volume now only holds HLS segment working files and `/data/backups`,
   so it starts empty without data loss.

⚠️ **Losing the cluster loses all three services, not just this one.**
Everything above restores `sentinel_command`. `sentinel_license` and
`sentinel_sync` live on the same cluster and go down with it, and this
runbook used to say nothing about them.

| Database | Portable dump | Where it lives | Restore |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sentinel_command` | ✅ daily, `/data/backups` | Command Center's volume | `restore_db.sh` above |
| `sentinel_license` | ✅ daily, `/data/backups` | License Service's volume | that repo's `restore_db.sh` |
| `sentinel_sync` | ❌ none — snapshots only | — | snapshot restore (below) |

**Why Sync has no dump job, deliberately.** The other two write their
dump to a Fly volume. `sentinel-sync` has none, and giving it one would
pin it to a single machine, because Fly volumes are single-attach.

The original reasoning here was that Sync ran **two machines**, so a
volume would cost real redundancy. That is no longer the fact pattern —
it was scaled to one machine on 2026-09-09 and now scales to zero
between its 30-minute pushes, so there is no redundancy left to trade
away. The conclusion survives the reason changing, on stronger grounds:

`sentinel_sync` holds a **mirror**, not a source of truth. Every row in
it was pushed from a self-hosted operator's own database, which remains
authoritative, and the push only advances its cursors on confirmed
success. Losing this database entirely costs one sync cycle;
the operators re-push. A dump job would be a second copy of data the
cluster snapshot already holds, of data that is itself already a copy.

Don't "fix" this in a later pass without re-reading this paragraph.

**Restoring `sentinel_sync` therefore means a snapshot restore**, which
is cluster-level and brings back all three databases at once:

```bash
fly volumes list -a sentinel-postgres
fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id> -a sentinel-postgres
# Create a new volume from the snapshot, attach it to a fresh
# Postgres app, then repoint each service's DATABASE_URL secret.
```

Sync is also the least painful of the three to lose: it is a **mirror**.
The self-hosted customer's own database is the source of truth, so a
lost `sentinel_sync` costs them their cloud copy, not their data, and
refills as their installs push again.

### If only the machine/volume is gone

The database is unaffected. Recreate the volume and deploy; the app
reconnects to Postgres and comes back with all data intact. You lose
only in-flight HLS segments and the local copies of dumps.

If the app's address changed, update the **Clerk webhook endpoint** in
the Clerk dashboard to `https://<new host>/api/webhooks/clerk`, or plan
changes and org deletions stop arriving.

---

## Recovery targets (hosted)

- **RPO (data you can lose):** up to **24 hours**. Cluster snapshots and
  the `pg_dump` are both daily, taken at different times, so the newer
  of the two is usually less than a day old. Run the backup workflow
  more often to shrink it.
- **RTO:** minutes — dominated by the restore itself plus the ~30–60s
  app restart. Communicate the downtime (see `ON_CALL.md` Scenario E).

---

## Self-hosted installs: restoring from the cloud mirror

Everything above is about **this** hosted deployment. A self-hosted
operator runs their own database (SQLite by default, or the PostgreSQL
that `docker-compose.yml` brings up) on their own hardware, with no
snapshots and no backup schedule unless they set one up. Their recovery
story is the **cloud data-sync tier**, and it's a different procedure.

> A self-hosted install is on SQLite (the default) or on Postgres. The
> `pg_dump`-based scripts above apply to a self-hosted **Postgres**
> install as they do to the hosted one. A **SQLite** install is one file:
> back it up by copying `sentinel.db` with the service stopped, or live
> with `sqlite3 sentinel.db ".backup out.db"` (which is safe under WAL;
> a plain `cp` of a live database is not). `scripts/backup_db.sh` refuses
> a `sqlite://` URL and says so.
>
> A `sentinel.db` created by the last Python release opens as it is: the
> SQLite migration is the schema those models produced, and every
> statement in it is `IF NOT EXISTS`.
>
> The `pg_dump` scripts reach a compose-run database the same way they
> reach any other, which is worth writing down because it is the backup
> cron a self-hoster did not have before:
>
>     docker compose exec db pg_dump -U sentinel sentinel > backup.sql
>     docker compose exec -T db psql -U sentinel sentinel < backup.sql

**Who this applies to:** `AUTH_PROVIDER=local` installs whose licence
has the data-sync entitlement (`sync_enabled`). Without that
entitlement nothing is mirrored, and there is nothing to restore from —
their backup story is whatever they arranged themselves.

**What is and isn't mirrored.** Cameras, nodes, incidents, motion
events, notifications, and Sentinel AI config/runs, as raw column
values. Deliberately **not** mirrored:

- **Node API keys** (`camera_nodes.api_key_hash`). A restored node
  cannot authenticate and **must re-register**, which mints a fresh key
  anyway. The restore writes a deliberately non-hex placeholder so the
  old credential can't appear to have survived.
- **Incident evidence blobs** (snapshots/clips). The metadata rows
  restore — you'll know evidence existed, what kind, and when — but the
  bytes stayed local. If those matter, back them up separately.
- **Recordings.** They never left the camera node.

### Procedure

```bash
# `sentinel-restore-from-cloud` is a second binary shipped in the image
# and built from the same crate, so it reads the same DATABASE_URL and
# the same licence settings the app does. On a deployed machine it is on
# PATH; from a checkout it is `cargo run --bin sentinel-restore-from-cloud --`.

# 1. What's actually up there? Also the quickest way to confirm sync
#    was working — do this BEFORE you need it, not during.
sentinel-restore-from-cloud --list

# 2. See what would be written, without touching the database.
sentinel-restore-from-cloud --dry-run

# 3. Restore. Creates the schema itself, so this works on a machine
#    that has never started the app.
sentinel-restore-from-cloud
```

Then start the app and re-register each camera node to issue fresh API
keys.

### Things worth knowing before you run it

- **It won't overwrite existing rows** unless you pass `--overwrite`.
  Running it against a database that still has data is safe: rows whose
  primary key already exists are skipped and counted, not replaced.
- **A partial restore exits `2`** and prints each row it couldn't
  write. A bad row is stepped over rather than aborting the run, so one
  malformed record can't cost you the other 9,999 — but check the exit
  code, because a partial restore that reads as success is how you find
  out months later that data you believed was recovered never came back.
- **RPO is one sync interval** (30 minutes)
  — worse than the hosted daily backup in staleness terms, better in
  granularity. Anything written in the final half hour before the disk
  died is gone.
- Same rule as the rest of this runbook: **rehearse it.** Restore into a
  scratch `DATABASE_URL` on a machine you don't care about and confirm
  the row counts match `--list`.

## Rehearsal drill (do this before launch, then quarterly)

The point of the drill is to restore **somewhere other than the
origin** — that's the scenario the portable dump exists for, and it's
the half that a snapshot restore can't prove.

1. Run the **Scheduled DB Backup** workflow (`gh workflow run backup.yml
   -R SourceBox-LLC/Sentinel-Command`), or `bash /app/scripts/backup_db.sh`
   on the machine. Confirm a `.dump` lands in `/data/backups`, then copy it
   off with `fly ssh sftp get`.
2. Start a throwaway Postgres of the same major version:
   `docker run -d --name pgdrill -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=drill -e POSTGRES_DB=drill -p 15499:5432 postgres:18-alpine`
3. Restore into it — note this is the real script, not a hand-typed
   `pg_restore`, so the drill tests what production actually runs:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:drill@127.0.0.1:15499/drill \
     bash scripts/restore_db.sh <dump> --yes
   ```

4. Verify content, not just table count: row counts on core tables, and
   that Boolean columns still carry `default false` (the dialect trap
   that ADR 0001's 2026-09-07 update describes):

   ```bash
   DB=postgresql://postgres:drill@127.0.0.1:15499/drill
   psql $DB -c "select count(*) from cameras" -c "select count(*) from incidents"
   psql $DB -c "select column_name, column_default from information_schema.columns
                where table_name = 'cameras' and data_type = 'boolean'"
   ```

5. `docker rm -f pgdrill`. Write the date + result in the log below so
   "last rehearsed" is always visible.

## Rehearsal log

- **2026-09-07 (later) — Post-consolidation drill on `sentinel-postgres`.
  PASS, both services, no findings.** The earlier drill that day covered
  a topology that no longer exists, so it was re-run against the current
  single cluster. Followed the documented path end to end rather than
  shortcutting it: ran `backup_db.sh` on the production machine, pulled
  the dump off with `fly ssh sftp get` (the same step the workflow uses,
  so that step is now exercised too), and restored with the real
  `restore_db.sh` into a throwaway `postgres:18-alpine` container —
  deliberately not the origin cluster.
  Command Center restored to **20 tables, 83 indexes, 3 FK constraints,
  19 sequences**, the migrated `user_notification_state` row intact, and
  all three `cameras` Boolean columns still carrying `default false`.
  License Service restored to 2 tables with both licences and 3
  check-ins, `sync_enabled` still a real boolean.
  **Extra check beyond the runbook's steps:** ran the application's own
  `sync_schema` / `sync_indexes` against the restored database — it
  reported **no columns and no indexes to add**, which is a stronger
  signal than row counts that the restored schema is complete and
  current, not merely populated.

- **2026-09-07 — First post-Postgres drill, both services. PASS (with a
  finding).** Ran the real `backup_db.sh` against production
  (`sentinel_command`: 72 KB dump, 202 catalog entries) and restored it
  with the real `restore_db.sh` into an **independent** `postgres:18-alpine`
  container — deliberately not the origin cluster, since portability is
  the whole reason the dump exists alongside snapshots. Verified in the
  restored copy: **20 tables, 83 indexes, 3 FK constraints, 19
  sequences**, the migrated `user_notification_state` row intact, and all
  three `cameras` Boolean columns carrying `default false`. Repeated
  end-to-end for License-Service (`licenses-*.dump`, 21 catalog entries →
  2 tables, both licences and 3 check-ins intact). Then ran both scripts
  **on the production machines** to confirm `pg_dump` is present in the
  deployed image and the `+psycopg` URL is stripped correctly — both
  succeeded. **Finding:** `restore_db.sh` initially passed the connection
  URL positionally *and* via `--dbname`; `pg_restore` takes the dump file
  as its one positional argument, so it aborted with "too many
  command-line arguments" before restoring anything. Caught only because
  the drill ran the script rather than a hand-typed command. Fixed and
  re-drilled. **Still open:** `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` remains unset, so
  there is still no off-platform copy.
- **2026-07-06 — Fly volume-snapshot restore drill. PASS (with a
  finding).** Restored the newest snapshot (`vs_ggX2o2kX99xofojJJAJ35`,
  ~4h old, 5-day retention) of `sentinel_data` into a throwaway volume
  (`sentinel_restore_test`), mounted it on a disposable alpine machine,
  and verified: `PRAGMA integrity_check` → **ok**; all **20 tables**
  present. Row counts were 0 across the board — expected pre-launch (no
  orgs onboarded yet). Throwaway machine + volume destroyed after;
  production volume/machine never touched (no downtime). **Finding:** the
  DB file is `/data/opensentry.db`, not `sentinel.db`, and there was no
  `/data/backups/` directory. **Resolved same day** (see the reconciled
  callout at the top): the `DATABASE_URL` secret was repointed to
  `sentinel.db`, the app restarted onto a fresh `sentinel.db`, the
  leftover `opensentry.db` + orphaned `opensentry_data` volume were
  removed, and a `workflow_dispatch` of the backup job then **succeeded**
  (`sentinel-20260706T064510Z.db.gz`). `/api/health/detailed` reported
  `database: ok` after the switch. **Re-run this drill once there is real
  customer data to restore (non-zero rows).**

## History

- **2026-07-06.** A `DATABASE_URL` secret pinned to an OpenSentry-era file name silently overrode `fly.toml`, and the daily backup failed for about a day. That is why this runbook keeps saying the secret wins over `fly.toml`.
- **2026-09-07.** The hosted database moved from a SQLite file on the `sentinel_data` volume to Postgres on `sentinel-postgres`. The backup scripts became `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`, and cluster snapshots became the primary backup. The pre-migration SQLite file was left at `/data/sentinel.db` (and `/data/backups/sentinel-20260907T023056Z.db.gz`) as a rollback point. Delete it once nobody needs it.
- **2026-10-05.** The backend became Rust. Schema is now applied by sqlx migrations at start-up; the database itself did not change.

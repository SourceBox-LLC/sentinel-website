## 1. Clerk production keys

**State now.** The dashboard is using Clerk's test keys (`pk_test_*`,
`sk_test_*`). These work end-to-end for auth and billing in the
sandbox, but they're scoped to the test environment: real Stripe
charges don't post, and the sign-in card says "Development mode". This
is intentional until launch. The Clerk application is also still
named "SourceBox Sentry", which is what the sign-in card shows; rename
it in the Clerk dashboard.

**What you need to do.**
1. In the Clerk dashboard, switch the application to production
   mode (or create a separate production app and copy the
   user/organization schema across — Clerk has a one-click clone for
   this).
2. Configure the production Stripe account in Clerk's billing tab.
   Billing runs entirely through Clerk, which uses Stripe underneath;
   there is no direct Stripe integration in the code.
3. Update Fly secrets:
   ```
   fly secrets set \
     CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... \
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... \
     -a sentinel-command
   ```
4. Verify the Clerk webhook endpoint
   `https://app.sentinel-command.com/api/webhooks/clerk` is
   registered in the production Clerk app and signing secret is set
   (`CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). Test by upgrading a test org and
   confirming its `settings` row `org_plan` becomes `pro`.

   **Subscribe it to every event the handler reads**, not just billing:
   `organization.created`/`.deleted`, `organizationMembership.created`/
   `.updated`/`.deleted`, `paymentAttempt.updated`, `subscription.*`
   (`created`, `updated`, `active`, `pastDue`) and `subscriptionItem.*`
   (`active`, `canceled`, `ended`, `freeTrialEnding`, `pastDue`).

   > **2026-10-05:** the development instance's only endpoint still
   > pointed at `https://opensentry-command.fly.dev/…` — a hostname that
   > no longer resolves — and Svix had disabled it, so production had
   > received no Clerk webhook since the rename: org deletions never ran
   > the GDPR wipe, plan changes arrived only through the hourly
   > reconcile, and the membership events were not subscribed at all.
   > Repointed to the URL above, re-enabled, given the event list above,
   > and proven by resending an `organization.deleted` for a test org:
   > the signature verified and the org's rows were erased. Re-enabling
   > does not replay what was missed while it was disabled.

**Verification.** After the secret swap, sign out and sign back in.
The dev-mode badge in the corner should disappear.

## 2. Notification transport — Resend email ✅ DONE (live)

> **2026-07-05:** Resend is configured and `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` in
> production. The operator walkthrough is kept below for reference.

**State now.** Email is built and deployed. Each notification kind has
a per-org email toggle. Motion email **defaults off** and has a
per-camera 15-minute cooldown with a digest, to keep volume down.
Transport is Resend; the code is `backend-rs/src/email*.rs` and
`recipients.rs`, and the 46 templates in `backend-rs/templates/emails/`
are compiled into the binary and checked against a golden corpus by
`cargo test`. Bounces and complaints arrive at `/api/webhooks/resend`
and land in `email_suppression`. The sub-processor disclosure is in
`SUB_PROCESSORS.md` and `DPA.md`.

**SMS and mobile push are out of scope.** For those, wire your own MCP
agent to Twilio or PagerDuty.

**Operator action to activate email:**
1. Sign up at resend.com (free tier covers 3K emails/month — comfortably
   above realistic volume for the operator-critical kinds).
2. Verify a sending domain — Resend gives you 4 DNS records (SPF TXT,
   DKIM CNAMEs ×3, optional DMARC). 15-60 min for DNS to propagate.
   **This step is already done:** `sentinel-command.com` is verified,
   with DKIM and SPF/Return-Path on `send.sentinel-command.com`. This
   previously recommended `notifications.sourceboxsentry.com`, which is
   the pre-rename brand and is *not* a verified sending domain — setting
   `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` to it would have failed every send.
3. Configure a webhook in Resend → endpoint
   `https://app.sentinel-command.com/api/webhooks/resend`. Copy the
   signing secret (starts with `whsec_`).
4. Set the four Fly secrets:
   ```
   fly secrets set \
     RESEND_API_KEY=re_... \
     RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... \
     EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=notifications@sentinel-command.com \
     EMAIL_ENABLED=true \
     -a sentinel-command
   ```
   (Done — sending is verified on `sentinel-command.com`; the code
   defaults already match these values so the secrets are only needed
   to override. `notifications@` is a no-reply sender by design —
   support is a separate channel at `support@sentinel-command.com`.)
5. Smoke test: kill a CameraNode for >90s, watch the test admin's inbox
   for the offline email, click the unsubscribe link, verify the
   toggle flipped off in `/settings`. Then repeat for motion: trigger a
   camera, confirm the first-motion email arrives, and confirm a second
   trigger inside the cooldown window produces a digest rather than a
   second email.

**Code is safe to keep deployed indefinitely** with `EMAIL_ENABLED=false`
(the default). The worker still runs but the transport short-circuits
with a logged "would have sent" line.

---

## 3. Status page vendor (recommended)

**State now.** Two health endpoints live and ready for an external
monitor to poll:

- `/api/health/ready` (commit `6265b32`, 2026-05-04) — readiness
  check with DB + Clerk + disk + email-worker probes. Returns
  HTTP 200 when ready, **503 with detail body when any critical
  dependency is unhealthy**. 30s cached so a swarm of pollers
  doesn't hammer Clerk. **This is the better target for external
  status pages and uptime monitors** because it speaks HTTP status
  codes rather than nesting status in the body.
- `/api/health/detailed` — verbose status snapshot, always 200.
  Useful for dashboards that parse JSON; bad for vendors that
  only check status codes.

There's no public status page yet.

**Options.**
- **BetterStack** / **Better Uptime** — modern, generous free tier.
- **Instatus** ($20/mo for the smallest paid plan, free tier works
  for solo operations).
- **Statuspage.io** by Atlassian (more features, pricier).
- **UptimeRobot** — free tier, good for the "page me when it's
  actually down" minimum.

**What to do.**
1. Create a status page / synthetic monitor on the chosen vendor.
2. Point the synthetic monitor at `/api/health/ready` (NOT
   `/detailed`) every minute. The monitor only needs to look at
   HTTP status: 200 = up, 5xx = down. Body is for humans.
3. Link the status page from the website and from `SECURITY.md`.
4. Subscribe customers to status updates via the vendor's
   subscription widget — automatic for most.

---

## 4. Domain / DNS ✅ DONE

**State now.** Live and serving. `app.sentinel-command.com` (the app and
API) holds a Let's Encrypt certificate from Fly, valid to 2026-12-02;
the apex `sentinel-command.com` (marketing site, on GitHub Pages) is
valid to 2026-12-07. Both renew automatically. The app's own origin is
`FRONTEND_URL` (`app.sentinel-command.com`, set in `fly.toml`), which is
also the only origin Clerk sign-in tokens are accepted from.

Note the split, because it has bitten the docs twice: **the API lives on
`app.`, not the apex.** The apex has no `/api` and no `/docs`. Anything
pointing an integration, webhook or health probe at the bare domain is
wrong.

The rest of this section is a **procedure for changing domains later**,
not outstanding work.

**To switch.**
1. Buy a domain (e.g. `sentry.sourceboxlabs.com`).
2. Add a Fly cert via `fly certs add`.
3. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in `fly.toml`. It is the CORS origin, the
   only `azp` Clerk tokens are accepted with, and the base of email links.
   Extra origins go in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated).
4. Update Clerk's allowed origins, and the Clerk webhook endpoint URL.
5. Update the Resend webhook endpoint URL.
6. Update `scripts/install.sh` (Linux/macOS) so it points at the new base URL
   — this URL gets baked into customer CameraNodes at install time, so
   transitioning takes weeks. The Windows MSI doesn't need a parallel
   update because it's a static download from GitHub Releases (the
   MSI's URL doesn't change with the Command Center domain).

---

## 5. Sentry production setup ✅ DONE

**State now.** Sentry is fully wired and verified in production.
`SENTRY_DSN` is set in Fly secrets via the Sentry extension
(`fly ext sentry create -a sentinel-command` provisioned a sponsored
Team plan and auto-injected the DSN). `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1`
keeps us inside the free-tier event budget. `backend-rs/src/sentry.rs::init()`
no-ops gracefully when DSN is absent (local dev), so no extra config
needed there. Email alerting confirmed firing — you've received at
least one Sentry alert email (`OPENSENTRY-COMMAND-1`).

The disk check (`loops.rs::check_disk_critical`, at 95% full) raises
its alert as one `tracing::error!`, which Sentry turns into an event.
It deliberately does not notify customers: platform disk is the
operator's problem, not theirs (commit `594b86c`).

Dashboard: `fly ext sentry dashboard -a sentinel-command`.

---

## 6. Legal: terms, privacy policy and DPA review

**State now.** I wrote `docs/legal/DPA.md` and
`docs/legal/SUB_PROCESSORS.md` as engineering-truth working drafts.
Both lead with `DRAFT — NOT FOR EXECUTION` so nobody can sign them
accidentally.

**What you need to do.**
1. Find a privacy lawyer. Many SaaS-friendly firms have flat-fee
   "starter DPA review" packages for early-stage companies in the
   $1.5–4K range.
2. Send them the markdown drafts. They will return a redlined PDF.
3. Save the lawyer-approved PDF in your records system (NOT in this
   repo — the markdown stays as the engineering record).
4. When sub-processors change, update `SUB_PROCESSORS.md` in master
   and email the billing contact (per the DPA's 14-day notice
   policy). The repo edit IS the public notice.

**Terms of Service and Privacy Policy: published 2026-10-06, not yet
reviewed by counsel.** They live in the `sentinel-website` repo
(`docs/legal/terms.html`, `docs/legal/privacy.html`) and are served at
<https://sentinel-command.com/legal/terms> and
<https://sentinel-command.com/legal/privacy>, the URLs sign-up and every
email footer already link. They were written against the code, not
against the drafts: they say incident evidence is stored, that Sentinel
AI sends images to Ollama Cloud, and that it is off until an admin turns
it on (which was made true in the same change; it used to switch itself
on). Governing law is Washington. Send both to counsel with the DPA.

When the processing changes, update the Privacy Policy in the same
change as the code, as you would `SUB_PROCESSORS.md`. In particular,
changing the first-party agent's `LLM_MODEL` changes a sentence in it.

**Things for counsel to look at in particular:**
- the liability cap (greater of 12 months' fees and US$50) and the
  indemnity, which applies to business users only;
- that disputes go to Washington courts, with no arbitration clause;
- whether consumers need a separate withdrawal-right notice at checkout;
- the Upstash entry in the sub-processor table: it is listed because the
  platform docs record Upstash as the rate-limit store, but
  `fly secrets list` was not available to confirm `REDIS_URL` is set.
  If it isn't, remove that row.

**Factual corrections the DPA drafts need** are listed in editor's
notes at the top of `legal/DPA.md` and `legal/SUB_PROCESSORS.md`. The
important one: incident evidence (snapshots and short video clips) *is*
stored in Command Center's database, which the drafts deny. The
published Privacy Policy already says so.

**Other legal documents you may need (not drafted yet).**
- Acceptable Use Policy (probably worth one, given the camera
  context — what users *cannot* point cameras at).

---

## 7. Backups and disaster recovery ✅ DONE

**State now.** The hosted database is `sentinel_command` on the shared
`sentinel-postgres` cluster. Backups are the cluster's daily snapshots
(kept 5 days) plus a daily portable `pg_dump` from
`.github/workflows/backup.yml` (kept 14 days). Both live on Fly, by
decision. Restores were rehearsed on 2026-07-06 and twice on 2026-09-07,
and the procedure is in
[DISASTER_RECOVERY.md](/command/docs/runbooks/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md).

**What to keep doing.**
1. Glance at the snapshots now and then:
   ```bash
   fly volumes list -a sentinel-postgres
   fly volumes snapshots list <volume_id> -a sentinel-postgres
   ```
2. Re-run the restore drill quarterly, and once more as soon as there is
   real customer data (every drill so far restored an empty pre-launch
   database).

---

## 8. Pi performance benchmark

**State now.** The CameraNode README and the `/docs` site describe
the node as running on "any Linux, macOS, or Windows machine,
including a Raspberry Pi". I haven't validated that actually works
under a realistic camera load.

**What you need to do.**
1. Get a Pi 4 (or Pi 5, increasingly common). Install Sentinel
   CameraNode via the install script.
2. Connect 1, 2, 4 USB cameras at 1080p / 30fps and watch:
   - CPU steady-state under load.
   - Memory steady-state.
   - Egress bandwidth to Command Center.
   - Whether motion detection completes within the segment window.
3. Document the result somewhere — at minimum in
   `Sentinel-CameraNode/README.md` under a "Performance reference"
   section. If a Pi 4 only handles 2 cameras at 1080p, that's
   useful for users to know upfront. If it handles 8, even better.

**If the Pi turns out to be too weak for the advertised use case,**
update the docs honestly. Better to say "Pi 5 recommended for 4+
cameras" than to lose a customer who tried it on a Pi 3.

---

## 9. GitHub repo settings ✅ DONE

**State now (2026-09-09).** Branch protection on `master`:

- `allow_force_pushes: false` · `allow_deletions: false` · `required_linear_history: true`
- **Required status checks:** `Backend tests (sqlite)`, `Backend tests (postgres)`, `Frontend audit + build`
- **Required PR reviews:** 1 approver, `dismiss_stale_reviews: true`
- `enforce_admins: false` — the sole admin can override via the UI. Defense against fat-finger, not against deliberate action.

This item previously read *"status-check + review enforcement deferred"*
on the grounds that there was no PR flow and checks "only kick in during
merges, so they're decorative in direct-push mode". Both premises are
gone: all work now lands through PRs, and the checks gate them.

`strict` (require branch up to date) is deliberately **off**. With it on,
every Dependabot PR needs a rebase whenever master moves, which stalls
auto-merge for no safety gain — the checks still run against the PR head.

**Two things this does NOT fix, both live:**

- **Dependabot auto-merge does not deploy.** GitHub doesn't fire
  `on: push` workflows for commits pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so an
  auto-merged bump lands on `master` without deploying, and CodeQL going
  green on it hides that convincingly. Needs a PAT
  (`DEPENDABOT_PAT`); `deploy.yml` has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger as
  the interim lever. See the notes at the top of
  `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`.
- **Frontend lint warnings don't fail CI.** `npm run lint` runs and
  fails on errors only, so warnings accumulate. The backend gates on
  `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`.

**Dependabot:** now configured on all four repos (Command Center,
CameraNode, License, Sync). Only Command Center has an auto-merge
workflow, deliberately — the other three deploy on push, so a
`GITHUB_TOKEN` merge there would silently skip their deploy too.

---

## 10. Customer support process ✅ DONE (inbox live)

**State now (2026-07-05).** Support + security mailboxes are live via
**ImprovMX** email forwarding on `sentinel-command.com` (MX →
`mx1/mx2.improvmx.com`), forwarding to the operator inbox:

- `support@sentinel-command.com` — customer support. Wired into the
  in-app `ErrorBoundary` crash screen, the `SUB_PROCESSORS.md`
  sub-processor-concern channel.
- `security@sentinel-command.com` — vulnerability reports. Published
  as the **primary** `Contact:` in `/.well-known/security.txt` (GitHub
  Security Advisories remains as the secondary channel), in
  `SECURITY.md`, and in the DPA's vulnerability-management section.

ImprovMX free tier covers this comfortably; note it handles *incoming*
mail only — outbound transactional email still goes through Resend
(item 2). Both coexist on the domain: MX points at ImprovMX, SPF/DKIM
(TXT) authorize Resend, so there's no conflict.

**Remaining (optional, not blocking).**
1. Define an internal first-response target (e.g. within 1 business
   day). Don't promise an SLA on the public site at the Free / Pro
   tiers (the security page already says "No formal SLA on Free or
   Pro").
2. Keep the website's documentation current
   (<https://sentinel-command.com/documentation/>) so customers can
   self-serve the common questions before they email.

---

## 11. On-call rotation

**State now.** You're a one-person team. The runbook
(`docs/runbooks/ON_CALL.md`) is written as if any human can pick up
a page.

**What you need to do later.**
1. As soon as you have a second engineer / co-maintainer, define a
   PagerDuty (or alternative) rotation.
2. Update the runbook with rotation contact info.
3. The runbook itself doesn't change — it's already in the
   "scannable under pressure" shape.

---

## 12. Final go/no-go checklist (to run the day before launch)

```
[ ] Clerk production keys swapped (item 1)
[X] Backup restore tested (item 7) — rehearsed 2026-07-06 and 2026-09-07;
    Fly-only backups are an accepted decision
[ ] DPA + sub-processors PDF on file with lawyer signoff (item 6)
[ ] Status page live and pointed at /api/health/ready (item 3)
[X] Sentry alerts confirmed firing in production env (item 5)        — done 2026-05-03
[X] Custom domain live + Clerk allows it (item 4)                   — app.sentinel-command.com
[X] Branch protection enabled on master (item 9)                      — done 2026-05-04
[X] Support inbox configured and monitored (item 10)                 — done 2026-07-05 (ImprovMX: support@ + security@)
[X] Resend signup + EMAIL_ENABLED=true + smoke test (item 2)         — done
[ ] Run `cd backend-rs && cargo fmt --check && cargo test && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
    — green, zero warnings (the agent's tests included: same crate)
[ ] Run `cd frontend && npm run build && npm audit --omit=dev` — both clean
[ ] Browse the live app at 375px, 1024px, 1440px — nothing broken
[ ] Clerk webhook endpoint enabled, pointed at app.sentinel-command.com,
    subscribed to the full event list (item 1)
[ ] Hit https://app.sentinel-command.com/api/health/detailed — overall "healthy", DB latency < 50ms,
    disk.percent_used < 80%, resend.status either "ok" or
    "unconfigured" (intentional pre-launch)
```

When every box is checked, ship the launch announcement.

## What's shipped since the original draft (audit trail)

> A historical record. File names below from before October 2026 refer
> to the deleted Python backend (`backend/app/…`); the behaviour lives on
> in `backend-rs/`.

- **2026-04-26 → 2026-05-01:** SaaS-readiness sweep — composite
  indexes on McpActivityLog + MotionEvent, disk-full alarm in
  `/api/health/detailed`, motion-ingestion per-org kill switch,
  HLS global byte-cap eviction. Tigris/AWS dead-secret cleanup.
  Marketing pass 1+2 (SEO meta + benefit-first hero copy + Clerk
  dark theme). Docs drift fixes (Postgres→SQLite, `~15s`→`~60s`
  cache buffer, MCP tool count corrections, SLA wording).
- **2026-05-02:** Verified Sentry production setup (item 5 done).
- **2026-05-03:** Email v1 — Resend transport + worker + recipient
  lookup + 3 new tables, `create_notification` email side-channel,
  `/api/webhooks/resend`, disk-check loop, templates + UI + copy
  sweep + DPA + sub-processor disclosure. Three review-fix commits
  (idempotency-key routing, rate-limit on unsubscribe, EmailLog +
  EmailOutbox retention).
- **2026-05-04:** Multi-tenant violation removed (`disk_critical`
  no longer routes to customers — operator-only Sentry path).
  Four new email kinds added (camera/node recovery, MCP key audit,
  CameraNode disk warning, member audit via Clerk webhook). Motion
  email v1.1 with per-camera cooldown + digest. CI workflow
  rewritten three times (Fly remote builder → depot.dev → local
  Buildkit on the runner) after WireGuard auth regression on Fly's
  side. Branch protection on master.
- **2026-05-04 → 2026-05-05 (SaaS launch-checklist closeout, 14
  commits):** Operator-debugging hygiene — per-request IDs in a
  contextvar, ContextFilter that injects `request_id`+`org_id`
  into every log line, Sentry tag, `X-Request-Id` response
  header, ruff in CI with conservative ruleset.  Multi-tenant
  rate-limit audit caught + closed 7 missing-decorator endpoints
  including 3 SSE streams, 4 admin DB endpoints, the incident-
  evidence proxy, and a custom in-memory connect-throttle for
  the WebSocket (the HTTP limiter does not cover an upgrade).  Full first-touch UX
  pass — welcome email on `organization.created`, Help link in
  authenticated nav, in-app CameraNode install widget that
  auto-creates a node + bakes credentials into the displayed
  one-liner, contextual `?` tooltips on the three highest-
  confusion settings, member promotion-request button.  Audit-
  log CSV export across all three audit endpoints with shared
  streaming helper.  RFC 9116 `/.well-known/security.txt` with
  rolling 11-month Expires + full Vulnerability Disclosure
  Policy section on `/security` with CFAA safe-harbour
  language.  GDPR Article 17 cascade gap-fix (both
  `danger/full-reset` and the `organization.deleted` Clerk
  webhook were only clearing 5–7 of 14 org-scoped tables —
  fixed via `app/core/gdpr.py` as single source of truth) +
  Article 20 export endpoint streaming a ZIP per table.
  `/api/health/ready` with DB + Clerk + disk + email-worker
  probes returning 503 on critical failure (the existing
  `/api/health` and `/detailed` always returned 200, useless
  for external uptime monitors).  `pip-audit` in CI for backend
  deps; `vitest` wired into the frontend CI step (suite existed
  but wasn't running, gated nothing); 23 new frontend tests
  including one that caught a real interaction bug in
  HelpTooltip on touch devices.  Closer: built
  `OrgAuditLogPanel` admin component on top of the now-
  paginated `/api/audit-logs`, completing the admin
  dashboard's audit surface.  Backend tests 464 → 549.
- **2026-05-05 cleanup pass:** Pulled `drop_orphan_tables`
  and `sanitize_existing_codecs` out of the boot path (one-shot
  fixes that had been no-op'ing for weeks); kept as documented
  helpers for snapshot-restore.  Deleted dead `EmptyState`
  component + tests (superseded by `WelcomeHero`).  Renamed
  misleading "Recording toggled (legacy)" audit label.
  Replaced dead `legal@sourcebox.dev` contact in `LegalPage.jsx`
  with in-app self-serve (Settings → Privacy & Data) for
  Article 17 / 20 / CCPA + GitHub Issues for everything else
  until the `legal@` mailbox lands.
